# moving-block-game
A simple moving block game made only on JS. Move it with your arrow keys, 'space' to jump, 'ctrl' to sit.
Decided not to include CSS file, instead added myself by using JS only.
This task was one of my tasks while studying front-end in IT Shool. I liked it very much and decided to share here.
